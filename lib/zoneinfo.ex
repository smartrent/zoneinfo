  Elixir time zone support for your OS-supplied time zone database

  Tell Elixir to use this as the default time zone database by running:

  ```elixir
  Calendar.put_time_zone_database(Zoneinfo.TimeZoneDatabase)
  ```

  Time zone data is loaded from the path returned by `tzpath/0`. The default
  is to use `/usr/share/zoneinfo`, but that may be changed by setting the
  `$TZPATH` environment or adding the following to your project's `config.exs`:

  ```elixir
  config :zoneinfo, tzpath: "/custom/location"
  ```

  Call `time_zones/0` to get the list of supported time zones.

  Return all known time zones

  This function scans the path returned by `tzpath/0` for all time zones and
  performs a basic check on each file. It may not be fast. It will not return
  the aliases that zoneinfo uses for backwards compatibility even though they
  may still work.

  The returned metadata is limited to what's available in the source TZif data

  information is available for dates used in your application. Note that proper
  time zone calculations depend on many things and it's possible that they'll
  work outside of the returned ranged. However, it's also possible that a time
  zone database was built and then a law changed which invalidates a record.
